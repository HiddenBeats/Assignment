    <h1>My Name is Michael</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Michael</strong>, and I am <strong>12 years old</strong>. I come from <strong>Lagos State, Nigeria</strong>, and I live with my family. I have <strong>two sisters</strong>, and we all enjoy spending time together. Sometimes we play games, watch movies, or help each other with schoolwork.</p>

    <p>I am currently in <strong>Junior Secondary School</strong>, and my favorite subjects are <strong>Mathematics, Basic Science, and Computer Studies</strong>. I really enjoy learning how things work, especially technology and computers. One day, I hope to become a <strong>Tech Engineer</strong>. I want to design and build amazing things using computers, machines, and maybe even robots!</p>

    <p>I am very curious and always love to ask questions and explore new things. I enjoy using the internet to learn, especially watching videos that teach about programming, how websites work, or how to build apps.</p>

    <p>Apart from school, I also enjoy <strong>playing football</strong>, reading interesting books, and sometimes helping my parents around the house. I try my best to be kind, respectful, and hardworking because I believe that good character is just as important as being smart.</p>

    <p>In the future, I hope to study <strong>Engineering or Computer Science</strong> at a good university. I want to use my knowledge to solve real problems in my community and help others through technology.</p>

    <p>That’s a little about me, and I’m excited for all the things I’ll learn and do as I grow!</p>
