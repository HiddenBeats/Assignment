        I want to become a <strong>web designer</strong> because I love being creative and using computers to make beautiful and useful things.
        A web designer is someone who creates the way websites look and feel. They make sure that websites are easy to use,
        nice to look at, and work well on phones, tablets, and computers.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was inspired to become a web designer after visiting some websites that were colorful, fun, and interactive.
        I thought, “Wow, I’d love to make something like this too!” That’s when I started learning about <strong>HTML, CSS</strong>,
        and web design.
    </p>

    <p>As a web designer, I will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use my imagination to create beautiful website layouts.</li>
        <li>Choose nice colors, fonts, and images to make websites attractive.</li>
        <li>Make sure websites are easy for everyone to use.</li>
        <li>Work with people and businesses to bring their ideas to life on the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I like both art and technology, and web design lets me do both. It feels like building a digital house
        where everything has to be in the right place and look great.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve started learning <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, which are the main languages used to build websites.
        Soon, I want to learn more about <strong>JavaScript</strong> so I can make websites interactive — like adding buttons,
        animations, and other cool effects!
    </p>

    <p>
        In the future, I want to become a professional web designer, work with big companies, or even start my own design business.
        I also hope to build websites that help people in my community, like school websites, online shops, or educational platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being a web designer will allow me to be creative, help others, and grow my skills in technology.
        That’s why I’m excited about this career!
